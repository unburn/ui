# Changelog

All notable changes to @unburn/ui will be documented in this file.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-06-10
### Bug Fixes & Adjustments
- **Fixed Dock Collapse Button Styles**: Restored the missing built-in `.unburn-dock-collapse-btn` CSS class to the collapse Button component in `Dock.tsx` so that it receives correct library styling.
- **Cleaned Up Unused Styles**: Removed unused CSS rules (`.unburn-code-terminal-icon` in CodeBlock, `.unburn-mobile-dock` in Dock, and `.unburn-voice-status-badge` in VoiceAgent) to minimize styling footprint.
- **Quality & ESLint Improvements**:
  - Removed unused `err` parameters in `Button.tsx` catch blocks.
  - Type-narrowed the frequency data array in `VoiceAgent.tsx` to eliminate `as any` casting.
  - Wrapped color updates in `useCallback` to prevent component re-render loops in `VoiceAgent.tsx`.
  - Deferred synchronous state updates in docs `App.tsx` router effect using microtasks to prevent cascading render warnings.
  - Created proper `GitHubRelease` interfaces in `ChangelogPage.tsx` to ensure type-safe release mapping.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-10
### Breaking Changes
- **Strict Component Prefixing**: Renamed all component property keys to have self-documenting camelCase component-name prefixes (e.g. `buttonVariant`, `accordionItems`, `stepsItems`). This completely prevents naming conflicts and attribute pollution with standard native React/HTML attributes on root components.
- **Removed Components**: Deleted the deprecated `Tabs` and `VideoEmbed` components. Please use custom flex layouts or native HTML wrappers for embeds to reduce bundle size footprint.

### Features
- **Interactive Button Group Layouts**: Added support for `tabs` mode (with smooth draggable and slidable glassmorphic active indicators), `split` mode, and custom group layout variants in the `ButtonGroup` component.
- **VoiceAgent Live Simulation**: Added an interactive preview simulator for the `VoiceAgent` component to visualize status changes and audio analysis waves dynamically.
- **Styles & Customization Trees**: Added custom hierarchy trees and target documentation tables under component pages to list all inner key overrides (like `classNames` and `styles`).
- **Visual Syntax Highlighted Types**: Enhanced properties tables with type pill tags styled to resemble code editors, alongside robust wrapping for multi-value union options.

### Bug Fixes & Adjustments
- **Steps Timeline Connection**: Fixed vertical timeline connector alignment in the `Steps` component on mobile screens to ensure the line stretches correctly when text wraps.
- **Mobile Properties Refactor**: Converted side-by-side grouped tables into clean, stackable separated tables with a custom `title` prop override.
- **404 Routing Fix**: Fixed routing issues where page refreshes resulted in layout breakdown or 404 views.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-05
### Features
- **New Components**: Added `Steps`, `Tabs`, and `VoiceAgent` components to the UI library.
- **Component Accent Colors**: Added support for custom `accentColor` configuration properties across `Accordion`, `Alert`, `Badge`, and `Button`.
- **Theming Engine**: Implemented system-wide global accent state overrides for Next.js and Vite workspaces.
- **Site Favicon**: Updated documentation site favicon graphics.
